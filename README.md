# Puzzle-a-day SolverðŸ§©

Solves [Puzzle-a-day](https://www.amazon.com/DragonFjord-Puzzle-Day-Original-Challenges/dp/B09BHV12QF?th=1) for a given date using depth-first search to place blocks on the game board until a winning combination is found.

This solver also uses a straightforward parallelization strategy to search large chunks of the search space with distinct cores. Flood-fill is used to minimize the search space. These additions reduced the search time from over an hour for specific dates to only minutes.
